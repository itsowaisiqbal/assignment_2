*HTML 5 Bottle Flip Game*

This is the extra project I still wanted to do even though I was given the choice. Its the one which took the most time but I ended up having a lot of fun with it.

//Phaser

I decided to go with Phaser as I got a very good headstart from their website and their resources are a great way to start. It also felt similar to the physics system in Unity as well as the whole scene configuration.

//Bottle Flip

Again, with the capabilities Phaser has, a lot could have been done to make this even more engaging and fun but with the previous points already mentioned and keeping everything else in mind I decided to keep it basic and this was more of a learning experience but I did manage to get a working game in the end.
